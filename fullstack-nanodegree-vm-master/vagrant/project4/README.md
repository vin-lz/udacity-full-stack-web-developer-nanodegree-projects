# Item Catalog

## Instructions

In this project, an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as a user registration and authentication system is developed. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.


## How to run

Bring up the virtual machine using vagrant as the course suggested. Use `sudo pip3 install flask`, `sudo pip3 install sqlalchemy`, `sudo pip3 install oauth2client`(and `sudo pip3 install pep3`) to install modules for Python3. Then simply just run the code with `python3 project4.py`.
